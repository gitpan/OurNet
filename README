This is the README file for libOurNet, the collection of Perl modules
by Elixir Group and OurInternet Inc.

This documentation is *extremely* outdated -- you should consult
OurNet.pm and each individual module's embedded PODs.

* Installation

libOurNet uses the standard perl module install process:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Note that scripts in bin/ directory could be useful tutorials, too.

* Introduction

This is sales-talk introduction to each of OurNet::* modules. Whether
it might be of use to you or not is unknown.

[OurNet::Query, OurNet::Site - Automated Fetching & Conversion Engine]

The contents of most web services are formatted in ill-structured HTML,
makes it extremely difficult to incorporate other site's services into
your own. Even if such hand-coded attempts are made, the lack of
streamlined representation forbids you from integrating other service's
contents, or re-formats them into the same style.

Take searching as an example: currently, most meta-search packages limits
you to a fixed array of popular general-purpose Search Engines, and are
incapable of take advantage of each one's unique services. The same
limitation also applies to price-comparison services, special-purpose
monitor sites (e.g. financial "stock watcher"), etc.

OurNet::Query delivers a totally customizable engine to automatically
monitor any web service's contents, and "wrap" them into any format -
XML, RSS, database, or HTML templates - without any hard coding. Totally
transparent to the end-user, they will feel as if these results are
offered by the same source, hence makes it very easy to build a site
filled with richly news, services and related contents.

[OurNet::FuzzyIndex - Full-Text Multilingual Fuzzy Search Engine]

It is often critical for a site to have its own index engine, either for
user to search the vast amount of data, to auto-generated "related links"
for each page, or to associate external information according to their
contents. But traditionally, such packages comes as a fixed "black-box",
forcing you to represent the data in a certain format, and offers no room
for extensions or improvements.

OurNet::FuzzyIndex uses Berkeley DB, a high-performance embedded database
system used by sendmail, Netscape Navigator among others, to store its
index data. This allows lightning-fast search speed while consuming very
little CPU/Memory resources, makes it the ideal solution for mid-to-high
volume service sites. It also supports a distributed databases option,
which optimizes each query to access only a small portion of database,
providing even more scalability.

OurNet::FuzzyIndex supports multilingual contents both in Unicode or
locale encoding, multiple query syntax/options (e.g. Exact, Boolean, Fuzzy
& Natural Language), and a totally extensible API supporting outside
filtering/parsing/translation components.

OurNet::FuzzyIndex poses no limits as to which format the data is in, or
where it should be stored. It accepts any source of contents, whether it's
from a local file, a database entry, or external data fetched by
OurNet::Query engine.

[OurNet::ChatBot - Context-Free Interactive Q&A Engine]

Although a search engine can find links relevant to user's queries, it
does not provide answer to concrete questions for Q&A services, like
Troubleshooting, Online Support, Call Center and Knowledge Bases. These
sites usually needs an Eliza-like "virtual personality" to interact with
user, directing them to relevant parts of the content instead of a hyperlink
to a 100-page-long online manual.

Traditionally, interactive query systems like Ask Jeeves requires a
hierarchical structured database, extensive chat-scripts, and could only
handle a specific domain of keywords.

OurNet::ChatBot require no reformatting of existing contents at all; it can
automatically parse paragraphs and sentences, then convert the weighted data
into a OurNet::FuzzyIndex database. You can also specify additional parameters
like keywords, weights and grammar at any time.

OurNet::ChatBot accepts multilingual natural language questions, and provides
the most suited answers by analyzing the index for each entry's frequency,
relevancy and importance. Additional references and links are also included
in the output.

The Context-Free feature of OurNet::ChatBot also offers other applications
other than Q&A services, such as to instantly turn a huge body of articles
and speeches into a "virtual personality" of their author to chat with users!

[OurNet::BBSAgent - Remote-Controlled Virtual User Engine]

Besides static page-based sites, many Internet services needs to interact
with users, like BBS, IRC, ICQ and Telnet services. There are no "search
engines" or "portals" for these services, simply because it was very
difficult to automatically gather their contents, or to post data on them.

OurNet::BBSAgent provides an object-oriented interface to those services,
by simulating as a "virtual user" with action defined by a script language.
The developer could then use the same methods to access different services,
to easily implement interactive robots, spiders, or other cross-service
agents.

The scripting language of OurNet::BBSAgent is easy to learn, powerful, and
has both flow-control and event-driven capabilities. The engine also accepts
action scripts written in another language. Multiple agents could be
dispatched simultaneously with multi-threading support.

[OurNet::WebBuilder - Distributed Web Service Solution]

The idea is this: The program part and template part of a page should
be seperated. The program would be named "<pagename>.pl", and uses
OurNet::WebBuilder to populate all variables in the template part,
plus all parameters sent by GET or POST requests.
